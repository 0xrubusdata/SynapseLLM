# 🧠 SynapseLLM

**Distributed Collaborative Reasoning Between Multiple LLMs**

SynapseLLM is an experimental framework for *multi-agent reasoning* between LLMs, where each agent contributes equally to a collaborative decision-making process.  
No master, no servant — just collective intelligence, score-based feedback, and convergence toward the most relevant answer.

## 🚀 MVP Goal: Collaborative LLM Consensus

### 🧩 Core Idea
Multiple LLMs answer a single user prompt **sequentially**, each reading the previous responses and scoring them.  
Every model is treated **as an equal** — no fixed teacher, no predefined hierarchy.

The system iterates until a **consensus response** emerges based on:
- Cumulative scoring
- Convergence threshold
- Shared memory

> Imagine five LLMs sitting at a round table, each proposing, evaluating, and adapting — not to win, but to agree.

## 🛠️ How It Works (MVP Flow)

1. **Prompt Setup**  
   User selects which LLMs to involve and in which order (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Claude).

2. **Step-by-Step Collaboration**
   - First LLM answers the prompt (persisted in shared vector memory).
   - Next LLM reads the prompt + previous response(s), gives its own response, and scores the prior ones.
   - This continues for all selected models.
  
3. **Scoring System**  
   Each model gives a score to prior responses based on criteria like clarity, relevance, and accuracy.

4. **Convergence Detection**
   Once a response receives the highest cumulative score and is not meaningfully improved upon, it's selected as the final output.

## 🔭 Future Vision: Modular Cognitive Extensions

SynapseLLM will later support **plugin-like agent roles**, enabling richer, more flexible multi-agent interaction:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧨 **Rebel LLM** | Challenges the groupthink, pushes for edge-case perspectives. |
| ⏱️ **Regulator LLM** | Decides when the conversation has reached convergence or stagnation. |
| 🧭 **Strategist LLM** | Optimizes the sequence and relevance of model replies. |
| 🔍 **Meta-Analyst LLM** | Summarizes the dialogue and identifies key divergences. |
| 🎭 **Mode Toggle** | Allows models to reply actively (free response) or reactively (to specific peers). |

## 💡 Why It Matters

SynapseLLM is not about competition between models.  
It’s about **emergent agreement**, distributed reasoning, and **building cognitive harmony** across different architectures and training paradigms.

This is **a step toward agent-level interpretability** and **AI-as-dialogue**, where the process is as important as the answer.
